# Power BI Projects

Welcome to the Power BI Projects section of my Data Analysis Projects repository! This collection highlights my work with Power BI, showcasing how I use this powerful tool to create interactive dashboards and reports that provide actionable insights from various datasets.

In these projects, you will find:

- Interactive Dashboards: Visual representations of data trends and patterns, allowing users to explore the data dynamically.
- Custom Reports: Tailored reports that offer deep dives into specific metrics, helping to uncover insights and support decision-making.
